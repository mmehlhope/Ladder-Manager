Welcome to Ladder Manager!

Manage your Organization

Now that you've created an account, you can manage your organization by adding ladders and other users.

Create a Ladder

Go to your organization's page and create your first ladder with the "New Ladder" button.

Manage your ladder

Once you've created your first ladder, you can then click "manage" to edit that ladder and add competitors,
matches, and games!

Click the 'complete' button on a match once you've recorded a few games for it. Completing a match will permanently finalize the scores, updating competitor rankings and ratings.
