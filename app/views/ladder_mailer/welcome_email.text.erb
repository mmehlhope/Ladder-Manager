Welcome to Ladder Manager!

Manage your Organization

Now that you've created an account, you can
%a(href="#{@url}" title="#{@organization.name}") manage your organization
by adding ladders and other users.

Manage a Ladder

Once you've created your first ladder, you can then manage that ladder and add competitors,
matches, and games!

Click the 'Complete' button on a match once you've recorded a few games for it. Completing a match will permanently
finalize the scores, updating competitor rankings and ratings.
