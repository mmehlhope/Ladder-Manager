Your admin password was changed!
===============================================

Your new ladder, "<%= @ladder.name %>", can be found here:
<%= @url %>

If you were the one who performed the change you can safely ignore this e-mail, if not, your account may have been compromised or another administrator may have changed it.

If you did NOT change the password...email me at mmehlhope [at] gmail [dot] com and I will do my best to fix it!

Thanks,
